# Another static site template for TEN7

This is an example of a static site built with Jekyll using some branding that indicates an affiliation with [TEN7](https://ten7.com/) but not a direct connection. This is [open source](https://github.com/ten7/static2.ten7.com), so you could use it yourself if you wanted to.

## Vanilla paragraph

It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. 


## Emphasis

**This is bold text**

*This is italic text*

~~This is strikethrough text~~


## Blockquotes


> Blockquotes can also be nested...



## Lists

    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!
